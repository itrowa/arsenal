                Each lab will provide various resources. As you attempt the lab, try to solve the lab by using the earliest step possible. Here are the resources provided for this lab:
                Wireframe.
                In the real world, a wireframe is generated to represent the design the business owner desires. Being able to translate a wireframe into a final product is a key skill all web developers need to have. Remember, a wireframe does not need to be matched exactly; a wireframe is intended to be a rough sketch of the desired result.

                If you're just getting started, or if the wireframe isn't clear about the target design, you can look at the screenshot. This is a sample of what the final result should look like.
